# mcpwr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mcpwr is to perform Monte Carlo power calculations

## Installation

You can install the development version of mcpwr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TJMurphy/mcpwr")
```

## Example

The poisdm function is a datamaker to simulate groups of Poisson-distributed
count data. The plot argument allows users to print a histogram and
jitterplot of the output.

```{r example}
library(mcpwr)

# generate data and graphs
# for group 1 (group of 40 measurements with a mean of 10)
# and group 2 (group of 50 with measurements with a mean of 12)

poisdm(c(40, 50), c(10, 12), c("group1", "group2"), TRUE)
```
